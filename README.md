**Air Pollution Prediction using Machine Learning**
**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict air pollution levels using various machine learning models. Accurate predictions can help in proactive measures to reduce air pollution, improve public health, and support sustainable urban development.

**Problem Statement**
Air pollution is a major urban sustainability challenge affecting human health, the environment, and economic development. This project focuses on predicting key pollutants like PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 levels to help city planners and residents make informed decisions to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution.

**Solution Description**
The project leverages multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, ElasticNet, Lasso Regression, SVR, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, to predict air pollution levels based on historical data. These models are trained on a dataset consisting of historical pollution data, meteorological information, and other relevant features.

**Key Features**
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical data.
Model Training: Various regression models are used to predict pollutant levels.
Hyperparameter Tuning: RandomizedSearchCV is utilized to optimize model performance.
Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on metrics like RMSE and MAE to ensure accuracy and reliability.
